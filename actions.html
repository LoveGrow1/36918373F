        <h4>Provide comfort in distress:</h4>
        <p>When 36918373M is upset or sad, try to be there for him even more. Acknowledge his feelings, offer comforting words, or even just sit in silence with him. It's not about solving problems, but about being present and showing empathy.</p>

        <h4>Balance personal space with family time:</h4>
        <p>Given the duration of your relationship and your shared responsibilities as parents, ensure you maintain a balance between personal space and family time. Plan regular family activities, but also respect the need for individual activities. This balance is important for both personal growth and maintaining a healthy relationship.</p>
